### On de Indefensibility of Welfare Rights 

[^0]: Reply to David Conway, “A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism”, *Austrian Economics Newsletter* (Winter/Spring, 1990).

David Conway claims say my argument wey intend to show de unrestricted validity of de homesteading principle, i.e., de first-use-first-own rule regarding unowned, nature-given resources, dey flawed, and say e fit demonstrate de defensibility of welfare rights. I remain unconvinced and contend say na e counterargument nai dey faulty. 

While I nor get quarrel with e presentation of my argument, I go first briefly restate my proof. Second, I go point out de central errors for e reply. Third, I wish to offer explanation for Conway rejection of my argument as say e dey come from a rather common misconception regarding de logic of ethical reasoning.

Whether or not person get any rights, and, if any, which ones, go only fit dey decided for de course of argumentation. E deg impossible to deny ds truth of dis witout falling into a contradiction. Arguing dey require  person exclusive control (ownership) over scarce resources (person brain, vocal cords, etc.). Denying dis go  again merely prove de point. Further,  person gats  acquire sis ownership simply by virtue of de fact say he start to use dese resources before anybody do am; odawise, he nor go ever talk or argue anytin to start with. So, anybody wey dey deny de validity of de homesteading principle at least wit respect to *some* resources go contradict de content of e proposition thru e own act of proposition making. So far, e don appear, Conway go agree. But he gl impose limitations on de range of objects wey fit legitimately dey homesteaded. Unfortunately for Conway case, howeva, once exclusive control over some homesteaded means dey admitted as justified, e go dey impossible to justify any restrictions for de homesteading process—except for a self-imposed, voluntary one—witout as e come be running into contradictions. For if de proponent of that kind restriction bin dey consistent, he for fit justify control only over some, altho limited, scarce resources wey e for nor dey allowed to employ for additional homesteading. Yet obviously, he nor fit den interfere wit another person extended homesteading simply because of  e own lack of means to do anytin about tam. And if he don interfere, he go as e be (inconsistently) extend e ownership claims beyond e own justly homesteaded resources. Moreova, in order to justify e interference he go get to invoke a principle of property acquisition incompatible with de homesteading principle: He go nid to claim (inconsistently) say a person wey extend e homesteading, and who do sam in accordance wit a principle say nobody fit argue to dey generally invalid, na, or at least fit be, an aggressor (even tho in doing so dis person nor go possibly dey said to don take anytin away from anybody because he for don merely appropriate *previously unowned resources*, i.e., tins wey nobody up to dat point don even recognize as scarce and wey anybody else fit don appropriate as well if only him don  recognized dia scarcity earlier, including anybody such as Conway, who be dey concerned about de fate of late-comers and be wan preserve dese resources for dia later benefit). To go further, say person wey interfere with dat kind action and wey do am in accordance wit a principle say nobody fit possibly argue to dey generally valid na, or at least fit be, acting legitimately (even tho he go always take sometin away from somebody wey e appropriations happen wey nobody sweat put).

The central error in Conway’s rejection of this argument is his refusal to acknowledge the logical incompatibility of his idea of welfare rights on the one hand—the notion that one can have enforceable claims against homesteaders—and of the homesteading principle on the other. Either the first idea is right or the second is. However, the first cannot be said to be right because in order for anyone to say so, the second one must be presupposed as valid. There can be no such thing as a right to life, then, in Conway’s sense of a right to having one’s life sustained by others. There can only be each person’s right to own his physical body, and everything homesteaded with its help, and to engage in mutually beneficial exchanges with others. Suppose, for instance, that I am terminally ill and the only way for me to survive is to have my brain short-circuited with Conway’s. Does he have the right to refuse? I think so, and I am sure that he thinks so, too. But he cannot have this right on welfare grounds (assuming that his life would not be threatened by such an operation), but only on the basis of the homesteading principle as the precondition of one’s existence as an independently reasoning and arguing physical being. Further, his claim that welfare rights are “every bit as objective” as those implied by mixing one’s labor with scarce resources (contrary to my thesis that the former are subjective, arbitrary, verbal, derived out of thin air) is fallacious. Through homesteading an objective link between a *particular person* and a *particular resource* is created. But how in the world can one say that my need can give rise to a claim regarding any specific resource or resource owner X, rather than Y, or Z, if I had not homesteaded or produced either one?! Not only is neediness incapable of objective identification or measurement: Who determines who is or is not needy? Everyone for himself? But what if I happened to disagree with someone’s self-assessment? People have died from love-sickness. Do they have a right to a lover-conscript? People have survived by eating grass, bark, rats, roaches, or others’ garbage. Are there no needy people then so long as there is enough grass or garbage to eat? If not, why not? For how long would the support for the needy have to last? Forever? And what about the rights of the supporters who would thereby become permanently enslaved to the needy? Or what if my support for the needy caused me to become needy myself, or somehow increased my own future needs? Would I still have to continue to support them? And how much work can I expect the destitute to perform in return for my support, given the fact that one is not dealing here with a mutually beneficial employment relation or voluntary charity to begin with? As much as the needy feel is appropriate?

Moreover, even if all these difficulties were overcome, more are lying in the wings because need does not connect the needy with any resource or resource owner in particular, yet it must invariably be particular resources that provide relief. The needy may be needy without any fault of their own, but the non-needy may be non-needy without any fault of theirs, too. So how can the needy claim support from me rather than from you? Surely that would be utterly unfair toward me in particular! In fact, either the needy can have a claim against no one in particular, which is to say they have no claim whatsoever; or else their claim would have to be directed equally against each one of the world’s non-needy.

Yet how can the needy possibly enforce such a claim? After all, they lack resources. For this to be possible, an all-resourceful, worldwide operating agency would be required. The owners of such an agency obviously would have to be classified as among the non-needy and could hence have no direct claim against anyone. Supposedly, only need creates such claims. In fact, this agency would have to be considered one of the foremost debtors to the needy, and it could only legitimately act against other non-needy if it had previously voluntarily paid *its* share of welfare debts *and* the needy had contractually entrusted it with such an enforcement task. Hence, the welfare problem would have to wait for a solution until this institution arrived. So far it has not arrived, and there is nothing to indicate that it will arrive in the near future. Even if it did, welfare rights would still be incompatible with the homesteading rule as an indisputably valid, axiomatic principle.

The explanation for Conway’s refusal to accept the homesteading ethic lies in a misconception regarding the nature of ethical theory. Instead of recognizing ethics as a logical theory, deductively derived from incontestable axioms (akin to praxeology), Conway implicitly shares a popular, empiricist-intuitionist (or gut-feeling) approach toward ethics. Accordingly, an ethical theory is *tested* against moral experience such that if the theory yields conclusions at variance with one’s moral intuitions, it should be regarded as falsified. However, this view is entirely mistaken and, much like in economics, the role of theory and experience in ethics is almost precisely the opposite: It is the very function of ethical theory to provide a rational justification for our moral intuitions, or to show why they have no such basis and make us reconsider and revise our intuitive reactions. This is not to say that intuitions can never play a role in the building of ethical theory. In fact, counterintuitive theoretical conclusions may well *indicate* a theoretical error. But if after one’s theoretical reexamination errors are found neither in one’s axioms nor in one’s deductions, then it is one’s intuitions that must go, not one’s theory.

In fact, what strikes Conway as a counterintuitive implication of the homesteading ethic, and then leads him to reject it, can easily be interpreted quite differently. It is true, as Conway says, that this ethic would allow for the possibility of the entire world’s being homesteaded. What about newcomers in this situation who own nothing but their physical bodies? Cannot the homesteaders restrict access to their property for these newcomers and would this not be intolerable? I fail to see why. (Empirically, of course, the problem does not exist: if it were not for governments restricting access to unowned land, there would still be plenty of empty land around!) These newcomers normally come into existence somewhere as children born to parents who are owners or renters of land (if they came from Mars, and no one wanted them here, so what?; they assumed a risk in coming, and if they now have to return, tough luck!). If the parents do not provide for the newcomers, they are free to search the world over for employers, sellers, or charitable contributors, and a society ruled by the homesteading ethic would be, as Conway admits, the most prosperous one possible! If they still could not find *anyone* willing to employ, support, or trade with them, why not ask what’s wrong with *them*, instead of Conway’s feeling sorry for them? Apparently *they* must be intolerably unpleasant fellows and should shape up, or they deserve no other treatment. Such, in fact, would be my own intuitive reaction.
