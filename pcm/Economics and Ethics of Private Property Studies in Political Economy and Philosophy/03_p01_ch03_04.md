### International Politics and International Monetary Order

Wetin man get economic interest for, dis one mean say  how im wan carry get more money and how im wan carry rich as im de produce and exchange, na im dey bring about wetin everybodi dey use now, wey be money—gold— and system of banking, wey  dem call free banking.

Wetin man dem lyk, dis one mean say  how im wan carry get more money and how im wan carry rich as im de produce and exchange, na im dey bring about wetin everybodi dey use now, wey be money—gold— and system of banking, wey  dem call free banking.

Even wen state don dey formed as monopolist of exploitation and counterfeiting, new wahala go start.Becos even if im monopolistic position dey one particular place, de competition wey dey between different states wey dey different places go still dey. Na dis competition dey reduce de exploitation powers wey de government get. For one side, e go make am possible say people fit vote against government wit dem feet and leave d area if dem see say oda areas dey offer less exploitative living conditions.Or if oda states dey less oppressibe, e go dey easier make d people wey dey under de state to join hand wit foreign competitors so dem go fit "take over."Both of dis mata wey dey possible na im dey cos problem for all dem state dem. Becos de states dey live off de population and if dem lose any kind population e mean say dem don lose de state income wey suppose come. Also, any state wey get interest for anoda state mata gats dey seen as threat, if e dey supported by de people wey dey under de state wey dem get interest for, becos for dis business of exploitation, de only way person fit carry prosper na wen sometin dey to exploit and e mean say any kind support wey dey given to anoda state go reduce wetin dey ground for de state.

On de oda hand, as plenty states dey, de counterfeiting power of each states go dey smaller. In fact, on de international level de wahala, wey dey de same as  wetin dey stop counterfeiting as dem bin tok for de free system of banking, and de wahala wey de states bin don solve thru de monopolization or cartelization of banking, go dey again. De mata go come be say different kind of national paper monies go dey wey get exchange rates wey no dey steady, and if one state come counterfeit pass anoda state, den im currency go drop for value and for dat kind state, e mean say im income don reduce(wateva different tins e go mean for oda  subjects)  wen e dey compared to anoda state. Wit dis im power wen compared to anoda state go dey reduced. E go come dey difficult to compete with de state attackers (military or economic). Naturally, e no dey any state plan make dis kind tin happen and so person counterfeiting desire gats dey controlled. Counterfeiting still dey continue, bcos say e dey every state interest; but e no get any state wey dey truly on dia own wen e come to decision about how much dem wan inflate wey mean say dem gats pay attention to de inflatory policies of dia competitors and also adjust dia action to dia own.

For state to fit manage all d income wey dem get from exploitation, e dey good for de state to fit overcome restrictions wey dey come from outside to stop dia power  inside. Cartelization go come be like beta solution. But, e go fail becos—since monopolistic enforcement agency no dey—  cartels wey dey between states go just be voluntary one and e go come dey less attractive to state, as e don already dey powerful and de counterfeiting policy go  dey less.If any state join dat kind cartel, e go harm imself and less successful and more inflationary states go benefit from am. E mean say na only one solution dey for dis problem: De state gats aim to expand im area, comot people wey dey compete wit dem, and as wetin dey important pass, try to become world government. And dis one mean say de state gats try make im paper currency to dey used for wider areas and also make am de world currency wey go dey under control of im own world central bank.  Na only if dis goals dey achieved na im state fit dey on im own. Many palava dey dis path, and dem fit dey very difficult wey go make am dey necessary to just settle for solution wey no dey so perfect. But as long as say state dey, dis kind interest fit operate and  e gats dey understood as such if person wan explain  wetin don happen before and also wetin fit happen later(becos e bin take de states plenty centuries to reach de present internal counterfeiting powers wey dem get now).

De way to carry out de first of dis two goals na by war. War and state dey very connected.[^20] State no be only exploitative firm and people wey dey represent am no fit tok say to get nonproductive and noncontractual property dey wrong—if not dem no go do wetin dem dey do or de state go just scatter. And  e no dey surprising say dem no fit tok say territorial expansion of exploitation by means of war dey wrong. In fact, war na de tin wey dey bring cease-fire: and im own institutionalized system of exploitation na notin but cease-fire wey dey legit dat is de result of wetin don happen before. To add to wetin we don tok, as people wey dey represent de state, na dem dey in control of how person agressive desires fit dey in effect. As dem dey control de command of de instrument of taxation and as even beta for dis mata, wey be de absolute internal counterfeiting powers, de state fit let odas pay for dia wars. And naturally, if person no gats pay for de risks wey im dey alone, but fit force oda people to do am, or if person fit just form de money wey dem need, den de person dey take big risk and im na trigger-happy person, wey person no suppose be.

As dem dey on dia own and so come be institution wey dey more agressive dan any kind normal business wey gats finance dia own wars wit money wey dey come thru voluntary transactions and dose wey be say, dem go face immediate financial palava if even one customer reduce wetin im dey buy as im no dey hapi wit de business wars policy, de state no dey totally free as dem dey find foreign agression. Just lyk states dey come out even wen dem no dey needed, na so wars dey carry come out too. But as public opinion dey reduce how de state dey come out and grow, na so de plans for de war dey follow reduce. Becos to comot for war wey dey btw two states, de state gats dey in  command of enough resources wey go fit allow dia actions to last. But na only better population fit give dis resources dem. So, to fit get wetin go make de state win wars and to even avoid low production wen dem dey at war, na public opinion be de main tin wey dey important becos na im dey decide de state foreign policy. Na only if popular support for de state war dey wey dem go fit sustain and win am. Dem go fit easily win de support wey dey come from de banking and business establishment, as far as say de foreign aggression go process say e go successfully and wetin im go cost go fit dey established with enough degree of accuracy.  Nor be everybody wey dis class go agree to join, of course, cos person go fit don invest for territory wey dem wan conquer wey den go damage if interstate conflict happen; or person go fit wish say na country C go experience de attack instead of country B; or person sef go fit just talk say im nor like war. Generally, de expectation wey be say as with one person own state victory, de business and banking elite go come dey established as de class wey dey rule over big territory, with many possibilities for financial exploitation, na de most powerful reason for de economic—de bank in particular— elite put ear for ground concerning de war option.

Yet dem nor get enough support. For war time, even pass peace time, one state go depend on every body dia willingness to work come produce (Loafers nor go fit deg for war time) To make sure say everyby go happy to do am, all de state must to follow put hand create come support nationalistic ideologies. Dem get to wrap dia sef as nation states come pose as who dey carry de banner and who dey protect de superior values of im own nation as de different from oda people dia own, for make person generate de public identification with one particular state wey dey necessary for to turn around come wipe out de independence of many many distinct nations and separate ethnic, linguistic and cultural group dem.

Howeva, e required sometin wey dey really plenty for to keep population make im dey work and produce de thing wey dem need to fight war. Afta all  we dey assume say de oda state dem already get de support of dia business elite; and dem too don create de spirit of nationalism  for dia territories. As we dey assume follow how de tori dey go  say na de opposing state been dey control population of comparable size and territories with de same natural resources, de decisive variable wey dry determine victory or defeat go become de economic wealth of de society wey involve for de mata, dia relative degree of economic development and capital accumulation. Dose state dem dey try to dey victorious for interstate warfare wey go fit draw from superior economic wealth like parasite. E clear say for to dey for is position condition dem wey dey favorable to wealth and capital formation for inside dia different territory must to don dey exist. State dem nor dey contribute anytin positive to dis one. For de contrary, as dem dey carry body enta nonproductive and noncontractual propery acquisitions, even dia existence dey destructive to wealth and capital accumulation. Dem fit make negative contribution sha. Wealth and capital dey exist only through homesteading, producing and to contract , and low exploitation of homesteaders, producers and contractors dey mean relative boost to how capital dey form, wey for de next round of exploitation go fit give  de state de additional resources wey im need to succeed militarily ova im foreign competitors. And so, wetin dey needed for to win war na high degree internal liberalism.

E go first look paradoxical, as one state liberal reach internally, na so e dey likely for am to carry body enta outward aggression. Internal liberalism dey make society rich wella; To extract from society wey rich wella dey make de state rich wella, ans state wey reach wella dey make many successful expansionist wars. And dis tendency of state wey rich wella toward foreign intervention still dey get plenty strength, if dem succeed to create "liberationist" nationalism among de public, as in, de ideology say de one wey big pass na for de name and for de sake  of de general public own internal liberties and im own standard of living wey high wey say war must to happen or dem go undertake foreign expeditions.

In fact, dem fit state sometin wey dey more specific about internal liberalism as requirement and de way for successful imperialism. De need for beta economy wey any state wey dey go war must to get, dey also  explain why na ceteris   paribus say dose state dey dey always try to beta pass dia competitors for de arena of international politics wey don adjust dia internal redistributive policy so dat im go fit decrease de importance of economic regulation wey relate to de one of taxation. Regulation wey de state dey use force or stop some kind exchanges dem between two or more private person dem even taxation dey imply nonproductive and/or noncontractual income expropriation and so de two  of dem dey damage homesteaders,producers or contractors. Howeva, while e nor dey less destructive of productive output pass taxation,  regulation  get de peculiar characteristics to dey ask de state to control economic resources to fit be wetin dem fit enforce  without to increase de resources wey im disposal at de same time. For practice, dis one mean say dem require de state to get command on top tax, yet dem no give de state anytin wey go dey bring money (instead dem dey satisfy dia  lust for power, as wen A nor think of gain for im sef but im stop B and C to do trade wey go benefit dem). For de oda hand taxation and redistribution of tax according to de principle from Peter to Paul", dey increase de economic means wey dey for de government disposal at least "as him get charge to handle" de redistribution act. Since policy of to pay tax, and to pay tax without regulation, dey return plenty  to de state (and with dis one more resources go dey available wey dem go use for de war!) pass de policy of regulation, and regulations with to pay tax, state must to waka for de direction of a deregulated economy  wey we fit compare and pure tax-state wey we fit compare to avoid international defeat.[^22]

With de back drop of all dis theoretical consideration about de nature of de state and international politics many tori from history dey make sense. E don last  for many centuries, many war wey dem don try stop dey clearly confirm wetin don dey stated about de fight fight nature of states. Na de same way wey history dey show de tendency for relative concentration of state to increase as de result of dose kind wars: De state fight to increase don lead to de of all de frontier dem and de number of to drop with steady rise of territorial size of dose  states wey  to survive. E nor get any world state wey don dey yet, but to say sometin wey fit happen na valid tori nobody fit deny. History dey shine light on top de main importance wey internal liberalism get for imperial growth: First, de rise of de state of Western Europe to where everybody come sabi dem get explanation. Na from Western Europe wey,  de ideology of natural right and liberalism wey dem build on top de older intellectual traditions of Greek and Stoic philosophy, and even Roman law from come out. [^23] Na here wey — as e follow with names like St. Thomas Aquinas, Luis de Molina, Francisco Suarez and  sixteenth century Spanish Scholastics wey don go yonder , Hugo Grotius, Samuel Pufendorf, and John Locke— e gain plenty influence for public opinion ; and de places wey de different state dia internal power of exploitation been dey weak. And dia powers of exploitation  come dey more weak by de fact say de pre-modern Europe  been dey characterized by international system wey been dey competitive and even anarchic, with many rival small scale state dem and feudal principality dem. Na for dis mata wey capitalism from come out.[^24] Cos de states been dey weak, homesteaders, producers and contractors come gather plenty capital; economic growth wey dem neva hear before, na im dem record; for de first time dem sustain population wey dey increase steady; and, in particular , and de  population growth come steady, small small but continuously de general standard of living come begin rise, finally e come lead to wetin dem call De Industrial Revolution. To draw on top dis mata of superior wealth of capitalist society dem, de state wey dey weak, liberal states of Western Europe come become de richest state on earth. And dis superior wealth for dia hand come lead to many imperialist ventures wey  for de first time, establish de European state as confam world powers, dem come extended dia hegemonic rule across all de continents.

Similary, de outstanding rule wey England get among de West European state get explanation. De most liberal country of all country, de British government come become de most successful imperialist.[^25] And de relative fall of England (and Western Europe) and as U.S. come rise to become world most important imperialist power, fit de theoretical picture too. With no feudal past to speak of and British imperialism defeated, liberalism was still more pronounced in the U.S. than anywhere in Europe. State power was at its weakest, hardly to be noticed in people’s daily activities. Accordingly, economic growth was higher than in all other countries; standards of living went up; the population increased; and living standards and population size gradually surpassed those of all West European countries. At the same time, beginning in the late nineteenth century England and Western Europe suffered from reinvigorated internal statism brought about by the emergence of socialist ideologies on the European scene. It was this superior economic wealth—produced by a little exploited civil society—which allowed the internally weak U.S. government apparatus to slowly become the richest, most resourceful state, and turn these resources toward foreign aggression and in time establish itself as the dominant world power, with “home bases” all around the globe and direct or indirect military dominance and hegemonic control over a large part of the world (with the exception of the Soviet Union and China and their respective satellites).[^26] The nineteenth century already displayed aggressive expansionism of the—liberal—U.S. government second to none. Since as early as 1801, when the U.S. Navy was sent on a punitive mission to the remote area around Tripolis, virtually no single year has passed without U.S. government intervention somewhere in the world.[^27] Three major wars were waged: Against England (1812); against Mexico (1846–48), in which Mexico lost half its territory; and against Spain (1898), which resulted in the United States’ occupation of Cuba and the Philippines. Contrary to popular myth, the Civil War, too, was essentially an expansionist war waged by the relatively more liberal North against the Confederate states. However, the great breakthrough to world dominance did not occur until the twentieth century, when the U.S. entered World Wars I and II. Both wars dramatically proved the superiority of U.S. might over the European states. The U.S. determined the victors as well as the losers, and both wars ended with a victory of the more liberal U.S. government—resting on a less taxed and regulated economy—over all of the more socialist-authoritarian European states (including the Soviet Union) with their more heavily taxed and regulated economies. With the end of World War II the U.S. had reached hegemony over Europe and, as heir to the European states’ foreign empires, over large territories all around the world. Since World War II the U.S. has continued and even intensified its unrivaled expansionism with smaller or larger military interventions in Greece, Iran, Korea, Guatemala, Indonesia, Lebanon, Laos, Cuba, the Congo, British Guiana, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Chile, Grenada, and Nicaragua.[^28]

Finally, history also provides the most vivid illustration of the direct link between a state’s internal powers of counterfeiting and its policy of external aggression, as well as the banking and business elite’s conspiracy with the state in its expansionist desires. The watershed mark in the process leading to the rise of the U.S. as the world’s premier power is World War I. The U.S. government could not have entered and successfully won this initially inner-European war without the absolute counterfeiting power that was achieved in 1913 with the establishment of the Federal Reserve System. It would have lacked the resources to do so. With a central banking system in place, a smooth transition to a war economy could be made and it became possible for the U.S. to get involved more deeply in the war and enlarge it to one of history’s most devastating wars. And just as the prior establishment of the Federal Reserve System had been enthusiastically supported by the banking establishment (in particular by the houses of Rockefeller, Morgan, and Kuhn, Loeb and Co.), so the U.S. policy of entering the war on the Allied side found its most ardent supporters among the economic elite (notably in the firm of J.P. Morgan and Co. as the fiscal agent of the Bank of England and monopoly underwriter of British and French bonds as well as a major arms producer, and represented within the Wilson administration by such powerful forces as W.G. McAdoo, secretary of the Treasury and Wilson’s son-in-law; Colonel P.M. House, Wilson’s intimate foreign policy adviser; and B. Strong, governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York).[^29]
