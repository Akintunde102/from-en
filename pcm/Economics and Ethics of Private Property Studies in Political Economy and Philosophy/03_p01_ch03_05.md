Na only one important element wey dey mess from complete reconstruction of de international order wey dey now: money. Na for de state's natural interest to expand im corner militarily; and so, make person expect tendency wey dey waka go relative concentration of states. Na also for de state own good to carry body enter "monetary imperialism" (as in to shift im counterfeiting power reach big big corner dem); and so  make dem expect one-world paper currency  to happen. De two interest and tendency dey complement each oda. For de one hand, any step wey dey waka go de direction of international counterfeiting cartel dem dey bound to fail if e nor dey complemented by de military dominance wey dem don set up and hierarchy. External and internal economic pressure dem go try to burst de cartel. With military on top, howeva, to inflate cartel go dey possible. For de oda hand, once military dominate come come make dat kind cartel possible, de dominant state go fit expand im exploitative power ova ode corner dem without war and conquest. In fact, de international cartelization of counterfeiting allow de dominant state to pursue through means wey dey sophisticated wella (as in wey nor too visible) wetin war and conquest alone fit nor achieve.

For de first step on dominant state (one state, wey fit crush anoda state with military and wey be like e dey capable to do like dat, by de government wey im dorminate in particular)  go use im superior power to enforce de policy of internationally coordinated inflation. Im own central bank dey set de pace inside de counterfeiting process, and de central banks of de dominated state dem dey get order to inflate with de state wey dey dominate. For practical terms, dem dey keep de dominating state paper currency as reserve currency on top foreign central banks dem, and dem dey pressured to use am as basis for dia own inflationary action.

As e nor dey constrained by actual demand but only public opinion, e dey relatively easy for dormant state to win im goal. Conquest for direct territory  and de direct implementation of im own currency for foreign territory dem go fit dey prohibitive  cos of de how national or foreign public opinion be. Yet as im get de power to destroy any particular foreign government —eve though e nor strong wella to do take over—na small thing wey de dominant state need to succeed for monetary imperialism.

For inside, e nor go face any resistance at all. De government im sef go like de solution. For once im own currency go enter work as reserve currency for foreign banks den dem go come pyramid dia national paper money on top am, den  e go come dey possible for am to carry body join inside almost costless expropriation of people wey get foreign property  and dose wey dey produce income with no consequence wey person fit fear. And na so, im own banking and business elite don dey ready to accept de agreement cos dem too go fit safely follow for foreign exploitation. Banks dem dey enthusiastic. And de public dey ignorant  of wetin dey happen, or dem consider to exploit foreigners as small thing compared to internal problems.

Externally, matas dey somehow complicated. De dominated state go lose resources to de dominating state as de consequence of monetary regime. But e dey face de possibility of of losing im internal control altogeda, e dey naturally prefer acquiescing to scheme we nor only allow am to stay for power but to continue for inside im fraudulent expropriation of im own population by to inflate im currency for on top and for accordance with de dominating state to create paper money. For essentially de same reason wey bank and big business men, as dose wey first receive de respective state counterfeit money,  dey willing to accept dis solution. And de general public  for de dominated territories, wey through arrangement na subject to double layer of exploitation of foreign state elite on top national state  and elite, dey unaware of all dis fact identify am as one important thing wey cause im own prolonged economic dependency and relative stagnation face to face with de dominant nation.

Dis first step, howeva no provide beta solution. De international monetary system dey characterized by dominant paper currency, and plenty national paper money dem wey dey pyramid on top of am, and exchange rate wey dey free go up and down between dose type of currency dem.

For one hand, dis one nor reach satisfactory for de dominant state, cos unda all dis circumstances dem na plenty room wey dey for de possibility of im own currency to fall against odas, and dat kind development go be threat to im own role as dominant power. Nor be inflationary policy of some central banks we dey determine exchange rate. Ultimately and if things nor change , na purchasing power equality dey determine am.[^30] and even if say one dominated central bank inflate  on im own with de dominating central bank, oda factor dem (wey be lower level of taxation and regulation, for instance) go fit still make im currency appreciate against de one of de dominant state.

For de oda hand, de existence of plenty currency dem wey dey freely go up and down  against each oda na, as we explain before, dysfunctional of de very purpose of money. e be system of partial barter. E dey create informational chaos,  e dey make rational economic calculation to dey impossible, accordingly e dey lead to inefficiency for inside de very system of production wey de dominant state dey rest like parasite.

And so, for am to assure im dominant position and make im exploitatively appropriated income plenty, for anoda step dominant go invariably make attempt to institute international — abd ultimately universal— currency we dem dey control monopolistically and dey issue  eida directly by im own central bank or indirectly by im central bank to dominate international or world bank.

E get some obstacles wey dey for de road to get dis goal. Howeva, once de first step don complete, none of dem go dey hard to solve. Naturally, de dominated state  go lose discretional power for unda dis arrangement. But dis one go dey compensated for by de fact sat im own economy go function wella, too if calculated wahala for inside international trade reduce. As de tori dey go, de banking and business elite for de two country go stand wella in favour of dat kind monetary regime and dem go use dia close ties to their respective state and international connections to promote its adoption. For, after all, banks and industrial firms are also in the business of making money through production and exchanges. Freely fluctuating exchange rates are an artificial impediment in their pursuit of this economic interest. And they will be perceived as dysfunctional more intensively by larger businesses, because it is big business, in particular, for which foreign trade plays a more important role.

In fact, the most severe resistance to the adoption of an international currency is to be expected not from the states and the economic elites, but from the general public. Insofar as an international currency implies giving up an accustomed one, it runs against the very nationalism that all states eagerly bred for so long. This would be a problem especially if the public in the dominated countries were asked to adopt the dominant state’s currency directly—name and all—because the underlying imperialist nature of such a monetary system would then become dangerously apparent. Yet with some degree of diplomacy and patient propaganda, this problem seems solvable, too. A new currency with a new name must be created and defined in terms of existing national monies in order not to arouse nationalistic or anti-imperialist sentiments. This new currency must only be somewhat overvalued against the various national monies (which in turn are defined in terms of the new currency) in order to drive all national monies out of circulation (in accordance with Gresham’s law).[^31] This must be accompanied by the states’ and the economic elites’ constant appeal to the general public’s sound economic intuition that—regardless of all nationalistic feelings—freely fluctuating national monies are an anachronistic institution which cripples rational economic calculation, and that it is in everyone’s best interest to have an internationally (and if possible universally) used money such as the international banking system under the leadership of the dominant state’s central bank is willing to provide. Barring any drastic change in public opinion in the direction of a strengthened private property and sound money orientation and a correspondingly increased antistate vigilance, nothing will prevent the dominant state from achieving this complete international counterfeiting autonomy. And with a world money and world bank in place, and controlled by the dominant state’s central bank, a decisive step is taken toward reaching its ultimate goal of establishing itself as a full-scale world government, with world-wide control not only over counterfeiting, but also over taxation and legal regulation.

In light of this explanation of monetary imperialism and its function as a “natural” (from a statist viewpoint, that is) complement of military expansionism, the remaining pieces from the history of international politics fall into place. Hand in hand with the rise of Great Britain to the rank of the foremost imperialist nation state went a sterling imperialism. Not entirely free at the time of all internal obstacles in the way of counterfeiting, British-dominated countries were compelled to keep their reserves in the form of sterling balances in London, where the Bank of England would redeem them in gold. This way, these countries would pyramid their national currencies on top of the pound, and Britain could inflate sterling notes on top of gold without having to fear an outflow of gold. With Britain’s decline and the concurrent rise of the U.S. government to the position of the world’s leading military power, sterling imperialism has gradually been replaced by a dollar imperialism. At the end of World War II, with U.S. domination extended over most of the globe, and essentially ratified in the Bretton Woods agreement, the dollar became the world reserve currency on top of which all other states have inflated their various national paper monies.[^32] For a while, the U.S. officially still maintained the pretense of redeeming foreign central banks’ dollars in gold, and this somewhat limited its own inflationary potential. However, it did not prevent steady dollar counterfeiting on top of gold from occurring. The position of the U.S. as a militarily dominant international power (in the meantime formalized through a number of military pacts, most notably the NATO) allowed it to compel foreign governments to exercise their right to ask for redemption only sparingly if at all, so that its own dollar inflation could take place without setting off contractive consequences. And when its counterfeiting policy had incited foreign governments to become all too daring in their attempts to obtain gold at bargain prices, it was the U.S. government’s superior military might that finally allowed it to give up all pretense and declare its notes irredeemable. Since then the Federal Reserve System has acquired the position of an autonomous counterfeiter of last resort to the entire international banking system.[^33]

The imperialist nature of this dollar standard takes effect in particular through such instruments as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the Bank for International Settlement (BIS).[^34] Money and credit, created by the strike of a pen, is passed from these U.S.-dominated institutions first to foreign governments which inflate their national currencies on top of it and in turn pass this money on to their own cartelized banking system which, adding a further dose of counterfeiting, then hand it on to the various states’ favorite business establishments whence it ripples to the economic periphery. Parallel to this flow of money goes a reversed process of income and wealth redistribution from the periphery onto national business and banking elites and the various nation states as well as from the dominated territories to the U.S. government and the U.S. banking and business establishment as the ultimate center of world finance.

From a sociological point of view, the consequences are particularly interesting if these two integrated processes are superimposed on pre-modern, feudal societies. Such countries, primarily in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, are typically characterized by a class of feudal landlords, or feudal landlords-turned-financial-orindustrial-magnates controlling the state apparatus and mostly residing in the capital-city-and-seat-of-government; and by a class of largely landless, dependent peasants dispersed over the countryside and sustaining the state, the feudal elite, and the capital city through the payment of land rents.[^35] Dollar imperialism here means upholding feudal rule, supporting and participating in the exploitation of an impoverished peasantry and the countryside by a parasitic feudal caste and the capital city, and contributing in the latter’s suppression of any liberationist land reform movement. In fact, the typical Third World cycle of ruthless government oppression, revolutionary movements, civil war, renewed suppression, and prolonged economic dependency and mass poverty is to a significant extent caused and maintained by the U.S.-dominated international monetary system.

Since 1971, in particular, increased efforts have been undertaken in the direction of the second step in the process of monetary expansionism. Not all of the roughly 160 freely fluctuating currencies actually pose a problem, because most of them are in no danger for internal reasons of appreciating against the dollar and thereby strengthening the respective states’ power vis-à-vis that of the U.S. government, or they play such a minor role in international trade that the calculational chaos which is introduced by their existence is largely insignificant. However, because of the relative strength of their currencies and their important role in international trade, the major West European states as well as Japan are a problem. Hence it is to these states and currencies in particular that U.S-led attempts to create a world currency that helps rationalize economic calculation and at the same time safeguard U.S. domination and further increase its own inflationary powers have been directed. The creation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), defined initially in terms of sixteen and later five leading export nations, and issued by the IMF, was a move toward a one-world currency and a one-world bank under U.S. domination.[^36] Another important push toward this goal was provided through the activities of the Trilateral Commission (TC), founded in 1973 as an offshoot of David Rockefeller’s Council on Foreign Relations. Composed of some 300 highly influential politicians, bankers, businessmen, as well as intellectuals and journalists from North America, Western Europe and Japan, the TC has made the establishment of a world paper currency and a world central bank its primary concern.[^37] Fervently supported by the TC as an intermediate step toward this ultimate goal as well as by several other politicianbanker-industrialist associations with a substantial overlap of membership with the TC and devoted to the same ends, such as the Action Committee for Europe, the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe, the Banking Federation of the European Community, the ECU Banking Association, the Basel Committee and the Wilton Park Group, great advances have been made in aligning the European monetary front. In 1979, the newly created European Currency Unit (ECU), issued under the aegis of the European Economic Community, first appeared. Defined as a weighted average of ten European currencies, and assisted by organizations such as the European Monetary System, the European Investment Bank, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, and the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, the ECU has assumed a more and more important rule. Since as an average it is less volatile than the various national currencies, multinational banks and corporations in particular have found it increasingly attractive to use the ECU as a unit of account and a medium of settlement: economic calculation is less haphazard with only three currencies—the ECU, the yen, and the dollar—than with a dozen. In 1998, according to official intergovernmental agreements, the European Central Bank was established and the ECU became the all-European currency supplanting all national monies.[^38]

With the European calculational chaos solved, then, and in particular with the European hard currency countries neutralized and weakened within a cartel that by its very nature favors more against less inflationary countries so as to protect and prolong U.S. hegemony over Europe, little indeed would remain to be done. With essentially only three central banks and currencies and U.S. dominance over Europe and Japan, the most likely candidates to be chosen as a U.S-dominated World Central Bank are the IMP or the BIS: and under its aegis then, initially defined as a basket of the dollar, the ECU, and the yen, the “phoenix” (or whatever else its name may be) will rise as a one-world paper currency—unless, that is, public opinion as the only constraint on government growth undergoes a substantial change and the public begins to understand the lesson explained in this book: that economic rationality as well as justice and morality demand a worldwide gold standard and free, 100-percentreserve banking as well as free markets worldwide; and that world government, a world central bank and a world paper currency—contrary to the deceptive impression of representing universal values—actually means the universalization and intensification of exploitation, counterfeiting-fraud and economic destruction.[^39]
