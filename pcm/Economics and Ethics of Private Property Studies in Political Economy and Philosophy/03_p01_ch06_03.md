### From Deposit and Loan Banking to Small Reserve Banking: De Fall of Credit

Banks dey do two different konk task, and na only one we don dey talk since.[^20] One tin dem dey do be say, na wia people dey put dia money, dem dey guard dey clear service for people. Dem dey collect deposit of (commodity) money and dey give identity to money (warehouse receipts; oda type of money) to people wey dey put money dia, dem fit collect am equal and if dem ask for am. All de evidence of money dem give person dem dey hold de same amount of money for dia hand, and person fit collect am back (100 percent reserve banking). Dem no dey put extra money for deposit. But people wey dey deposit dey pay money for de security and clearing service bank dey give dem. For condition for free competition- to de enta bank industry free- de deposit fee, wey makeup de bank gain and how dem take dey get money, em dey be small fee; and de gain- or self, interest dem collect- wey dem gain for bank na de same wit oda one, wey nor concern banking industry.

For de oda hand, em dey very different from oda company dem dey deposit, bank be like middlemen between people wey dey save and wey dey invest- like loan banks. For dis kind function dem dey first offer and enta time-contracts wit people wey dey save. People wey dey save dey loan bank money for short or long time to take exchange for de bank’ wetin dey talk for de contract to repay de money for front wit interest on top. From de way people wey dey save money dey see am, dem dey exchange money for de promise of de future own: de interest form part of dia gain to dey wait. As dem don get de temporary ownership of de savings from people wey dey save, bank go den reloan de same money to people wey dey invest (even demself) take exchange to pay de money back for future wit interest. De difference for de interest- de difference wey dey for de interest for people wey dey save and de ones wey dey borrow- dey show dey price wey dey between doz wey dey save and de ones wey dey invest and em form part of de gain bank dey make from loan. As em concern deposit banking and deposit fee, unda dia competition de amount inbetween dey be small cost, and de gain from loan banking go also be de same as de one dem gain from anoda place.

Nor be deposit banking nor be loan banking as dem put am for here show say if dem increase money supply or income for one side or share de wealth. For every new deposit note dem issue dem dey take equal amount comot for circulation (na only de form of money dey change, nor be em size), and as dem do loan banking de same total money dey change hand dey repeat. All de exchange- wey dey between dos wey deposit and depositing institution as well dos wey dey save, de main bank and dos wey invest- dey both get advantage.

Against, fractional reserve banking wey involve deliberate confusion wey dey de deposit and de loan role. Em show say em dem increase money supply, and em lead to dey share de gain for one side favour bank con join economic slack for form of boom-bust business cycles.

De confusion of both de banking role come to light for de fact say unda fractiotional reserve banking, or dos wey dey deposit dey collect interest (rada dan go pay one fee), and dos wey dey save dey get right to witdraw instantly (rada dan to dey wait wit dia request to reclaim until em reach one certain time for future). Technically, de possibility for bank to dey engage for dos kind practice dey happen base on say dos wey dey hold demand deposits (evidence to money wey dem dey get on demand, quick, and equal) commonly *nor* show dia right de same time. Normally, deposit bank go normally hold de amount of reserve (money main main) for excess of de main daily withdrawal. Em con dey possible for de bank to dey loan dis “too much* reserves to dos wey dey borrow, den dey earn de bank interest back (wey de bank go den partially pass to dos wey dey deposit for from of interest paying deposit accounts).

People wey dey support fractional reserve banking dey always claim say dis practice wey dem dey hold wetin less dan 100 percent reserve show say na ordinary good money “to dey economize,” and dem dey always dey fond to talk say nor be only de bank, but people wey dey deposit (dey receive interest) and dos wey dey save (dey receive instant withdrawal right shaperly) gain from de way dem dey do am. In short, fractional reserve banking dey suffer from two big mistake wey connect and em no bad but get big benefit. First be say, make em dey say anytin wey dey less dan 100 percent reserve banking dey involve wetin persin fit call legal impossibility, but to dey employ em too much reserve to dey grant credit, de bank dey normally transfer temporary ownership of dem to some wey dey borrow, although, dos wey deposit, get right to quick claim, to get back dia ownership ova de same funds. Even so, em dey hard say for some time dos wey dey deposit *and* dos wey dey borrow get special control ova de same resource. Two people *nor fit be* de special owner of one tin and de same tin for de same time. Normally, any bank wey dey do anyhow- to dey reason demand debt wey pass actual resrve- den go see am as fraud. Em contract right *nor fit dey* fulfilled. From de start, dem go reason de bank as wetin dey deeply bankrupt- as em show say em nor fit, against em own assumption, fit hold possible bank run.

Second, to dey lend dia excess reserves to borrowers, de bank dey increase de supply of de money, no matter weda de borrower receive de reserves wey be like normal money or say na like demand deposit (checking accounts). If de loan be like normal money, den de amount of normal money wey dey circulate go increase witout say dem witdraw de same amount of oda type of money from circulation; and if em con be checking account, den de amount of oda type of money go increase witout say den comot de same amount of normal money from circulation.  For any of de case, money go money now pass before, em go con cause de purchase power of money to reduce (inflation) and, for dis tin, to one pattern dem go distribute dia real gain take favour de bank and de people wey dey borrow wey be say na people wey no dey use bank and oda bank customers em go affect. De bank dey collect additional gain for interest and em no dey add anytin for de main wealth of dos wey no use bank (as de case go be if de gain dem get come from wen bank reduce how den dey spend,i.e., savings); and dos wey dey borrow get real, property wey no be money and dia funds, go con make am reduce de main wealth of de oda people wit de same amount.

Moreova, as far as say bank no dey simply spend de excess reserve on wetin em dey chop but dey loan dem out opposite to interest charge, everytime dem put business cycle for motion.[^21] De size of credit dem give big pass de one before. As result, de price of credit- de interest dem charge for loans- go fall pass wetin em suppose even be. For price wey low, dem dey collect more credit. Since money nor fit bring more money, make dem take dey earn interest back and legit profit on top of am, de persin wey borrow go need convert de money em borrow take invest. Na to say, dem go need buy or rent tins of production- land, workers, and self capital goods (wey be factors of production em bring)- wey fit produce future result of goods wey em value (price) pass de one wey dem input. Normally, wit increase for volume of de credit, dem go bound de resource wey dey now take produce *future* goods (instead of to dey use de consumption for now) dan em for be; so em for complete all de investtement projects now wey dey, em for need time pass wetin em require to complete only dos ones wey for don start witout say dem increase de credit. All de future goods wey dem for create witout dia expansion take add dos one wey dem add new base on de credit expansion dem must provide am.

Infact, for separate opposite to de matter wey de interest rate fall becos of de fall for choice for time (de extend wey dem like today goods pass future own), and den wen de public don save many make dem for make big fund of goods now dey available to people wey invest take exchange for de ones dem go get back for future, nor get any change for time like and to dey save don happen for de matter we dey consida. De public dem *nor* save more, and normally, de amount of credit dem add wey de bank allow nor dey represent *commodity credit* (de credit wey dey covered by nonmoney goods wey de people don comot dia hand to dey consume), but na *trustee* or *credit wey circulate* (credit wey jux come out from wia dem no know- witout say dem work for am, wey be like dem no chop nonmoney goods, for de part of de creditor).[^22] To say de credit dem add be commodity credit, de need to increase de size of de investment activities for dey dia. Em for dey enough big supply for goods wey dey now wey dem go put take produce future goods wey be say- de old one like de new one go start- investment project wey dem fit jejely complete and future eating for dey guaranteed. If de way de credit dey big na becos of to dey grant circulation credit, even self, de ensuing size of de investement go really show extra ambition. Misled am wit small interest rate, dos wey invest dey do *like say* savings don high. Dem witdraw many of de present resource wey dey for dia investment project, to take convert am for future to capital goods, dan say dem give am for actual savings. Even like dat, capital goods dia price go increase first compare to consumer goods dia price, but once say de public mind for time preference begin to dey show em self, one kind pattern of shortage for consumer goods go happen. Normally, de interest rate go jux go up, and na consumer dia goods price go con increase compare to de capital goods dia price, em go require say dem liquidate part of de investment like unsustainable malinvestment. De early boom go turn bust, em go con reduce de future standard of living pass de de level wey em for no reach.

Among current people wey dey support fractional reserve banking de case of Lawrence White and George Selgin[^23] derserve some kind yabbing, if no be for any reason dan say de two of dem dey yab Friedmanite monetarism who hear back, instead, for de tradition of Austrian and for particular Misesian monetary theory.[^24] Dia monetary standard na world commodity money like international gold standard and, base on dis, system of competitive banking wey, dem claim, go- and suppose permit to do am for wetin concern economic good and justice- put hand for fractional reserve banking and to dey give fudiciary credit.

As em concern justice matter, White and Selgin jux put one argument wey show de allegedly nonfraudulent character of fractional reserves: to comot dat kind practice go follow breach de principle wey concern freedom of contract to stop “bank and dia customer to dey make any kind contract arrangement wey dem two gree.”[^25] even self dis one nay eye argument. First, say as em concern history fractional reserve bank neva tell dos wey dey deposit say some or all of dia deposit go dey loaned out and em no fit ready to collect for any time. (Even say de bank dem pay interest for deposit account, and den em *suppose* dey clear say de bank *go* loan out deposits, dis one no show say anybody wey dey deposit undastand de fact. Infact, em dey safe to talk if few or any at all, even people wey no sabi economics.) Fractional reserve banks nor even tell people wey dey borrow say all de credits dem dey give na from thin air and dem fit recall am at any time. How, de, dem fit call wetin dem dey do fraud and embezzlement!

Second, and more direct, to dey believe say fractitional reserve banking dem go see am to dey fall under and get protection from principle of freedom of contract show total misundastanding of de main meaning of de principle. Freedom of contract no show say *all* common legit contract dem suppose allow am. Normally, if A and B join agree make dem rob C, dis one no jux follow de principle. Freedom of contract mean say instead make dem let A and B do any contract *wey concern dia own property*, yet fractional reserve banking na to dey don contract wey concer property of third parties. Anytime bank loan em “excess” reserve to who dey borrow, dat kind bilateral contract dey affect de property of third parties for three way. First, na by to dey increase de money supply, de level people wey get money dey buy go con reduce; second na say, people wey dey deposit dey hear word because de means make dem for take get dia belongings back go dey low; de third be say, people wey dey borrow- wey dey borrow commodity credit- em go affect dem becos dem put fiduciary credit em dey affect de safety of de whole credit pattern and dey increase de risk of say de business go fail for people wey dey invest for commodity credit.

In order say dem overcome dis disagreement to de claim say fractiotional reserve banking dey in line wit de principle wey concern freedom of contract, White and Selgin den, as dia last line to defense, witdraw wetin dem yarn before say banks go put “option clause” to dia notes, dey con tell people wey dey deposit say bank fit from anytime stop dia claim, dem still let people wey dey borrow know say dem fit pay dia loan back sharperly.[^26] Wey be say dis kind tin go stop matter like fraud, em con still get wetin dem go take yab am, dat kind note no go con be *money* but con be one kind *lottery tickets*.[^27] Na de function of money to dey be wetin dem fit sell again and most common goods dem dey accept, make em take prepare de owner to sharperly buy direct or indirect important consumer or producer goods for later later for future, em go be sometin wey show *absolute* and *unconditional* property right on em owner. Against dis tin, de person wey get de note wey dem for put de option clause *nor* get unconditional property title. Rada, resemble  person wey hold “fractional reserve parking ticket” (wia dem dey sell many ticket pass wia dem dey park, and dem dey do am base on “first-come_firstserved” rule), em dey entitled to participate to dey collect some prize, wey include ownership or time-rental services to some kind goods base on some kind rules. But na drawing right- nor be unconditional ownership titles- dem only get *short time condition* value until em reach time for de draw, and dem no go get value again as sharp as dem give de prize to dem wey hold tickets; den, dem go dey one kind *un*suited to use am take dey exchange.

As regards the second contention: that fractional reserve banking is economically efficient, it is noteworthy to point out that White, although he is undoubtedly familiar with the Austrian-Misesian claim that *any* injection of fiduciary credit must result in a boom-bust cycle, nowhere even mentions the problem of business cycles. Only Selgin addresses the problem. In his attempt to show that fractional reserve banking does not cause business cycles, however, Selgin then falls headlong into the fundamental Keynesian error of confusing the demand for money (determined by the utility of money) and savings (determined by time preference).[^28]

According to Selgin, “to hold inside money is to engage in voluntary saving”; and accordingly “an increase in the demand for money warrants an increase in bank loans and investments” because

> [w]henever a bank expands its liabilities in the process of making new loans and investments, it is the holders of the liabilities who are the ultimate lenders of credit, and what they lend are the real resources they could acquire if, instead of holding money, they spent it.[^29]

Based on this view of the holding of money as representing saving and an increased demand for money as being the same thing as increased saving, then, Selgin goes on to criticize Mises’s claim that *any* issuance of fiduciary media, in lowering the interest rate below its “natural” level, must cause a business cycle as “confused”. “No ill consequences result from the issue of fiduciary media in response to a greater demand for balances of inside money”.[^30]

Yet the confusion is all Selgin’s. First off, it is false to say that the holding of money (the act of not spending it), is equivalent to saving. One might as well say—and this would be equally wrong—that the not-spending of money is equivalent to *not* saving. In fact, saving is not-consuming, and the demand for money has nothing to do with saving or not-saving. The demand for money is the unwillingness to buy or rent nonmoney goods, and these include consumer goods (present goods) *and* capital goods (future goods). Not-spending money is to purchase, *neither* consumer goods *nor* investment goods. Contrary to Selgin, then, matters are as follows: Individuals may employ their monetary assets in one of three ways. They can spend them on consumer goods; they can spend them on investment; or they can keep them in the form of cash. There are no other alternatives. While a person must at all times make decisions regarding three margins at once, invariably the outcome is determined by two distinct and praxeologically unrelated factors. The consumption/investment proportion (the decision of how much of one’s money to spend on consumption and how much on investment) is determined by a person’s time preference (the degree to which he prefers present consumption over future consumption). On the other hand, the source of his demand for cash is the utility attached to money (the personal satisfaction derived from money in allowing him immediate purchases of directly or indirectly serviceable consumer or producer goods at uncertain future dates).

Accordingly, if the demand for money increases while the social stock of money is given, this additional demand can only be satisfied by bidding down the money prices of nonmoney goods. The purchasing power of money will increase, the *real* value of individual cash balances will be raised, and at a higher purchasing power per unit money, the demand for and the supply of money will once again be equilibrated. The relative price of money versus nonmoney will have changed. But unless time preference is assumed to have changed at the same time, *real* consumption and *real* investment will remain the same as before: the additional money demand is satisfied by reducing nominal consumption *and* investment spending in accordance with the same pre-existing consumption/investment proportion, driving the money prices of both consumer as well as producer goods down and leaving real consumption and investment at precisely their old levels. If time preference is assumed to change concomitantly with an increased demand for money, however, then everything is possible. Indeed, if spending were reduced exclusively on investment goods, an increased demand for money could even go hand in hand with an increase in the rate of interest and reduced saving and investment. However, this, or the equally possible opposite outcome, would not be due to a change in the demand for money but exclusively to a change (a rise, or a fall) in the time preference schedule. In any case, if the banking system were to follow Selgin’s advice and accommodate an increased demand for cash by issuing fiduciary credit, the social rate of time preference would be falsified, excessive investment would result, and a boom-bust cycle would be set in motion, rendering the practice of fractional reserve banking fraudulent *as well as* economically inefficient.

White’s and Selgin’s proposal of a commodity money based system of competitive fractional reserve banking—of partial fiat money—is neither just (and hence the term “free banking” is inappropriate), nor does it produce economic stability. It is no fundamental improvement as compared to the monetarist reality of monopolistically issued pure fiat currencies. Indeed, in one respect Friedman’s pure fiat money proposal contains a more realistic and correct analysis than White’s and Selgin’s because Friedman recognizes “what used to be called ‘the inherent instability’ of fractional reserve banking”, and he understands that this inherent instability of competitive fractional reserve banking will sooner or later collapse in a “liquidity crisis” and then lead to his favored regime—a governmentally provided pure fiat currency—anyway.[^31]

Only a system of universal commodity money (gold), competitive banks, *and* 100-percent-reserve deposit banking with a strict functional separation of loan and deposit banking constitutes a just monetary system that can assure economic stability and present a genuine answer to the current monetarist fiasco.
