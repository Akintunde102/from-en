### From Deposit and Loan Banking to Fractional Reserve Banking: The Devolution of Credit

Banks perform two strictly separate tasks, only one of which has been considered so far.[^20] On the one hand, they serve as depositing institutions, offering safekeeping and clearing services. They accept deposits of (commodity) money and issue claims to money (warehouse receipts; money substitutes) to their depositors, redeemable at par and on demand. For every claim to money issued by them they hold an equivalent amount of genuine money on hand, ready for redemption (100 percent reserve banking). No interest is paid on deposits. Rather, depositors pay a fee to the bank for providing safekeeping and clearing services. Under conditions of free competition—free entry into the banking industry—the deposit fee, which constitutes a bank’s revenue and possible source of profit, tends to be a minimum fee; and the profits—or rather, the interest returns—earned in banking tend to be the same as in any other, nonbanking industry.

On the other hand, originally entirely separate institutionally from deposit institutions, banks also serve as intermediaries between savers and investors—as loan banks. In this function they first offer and enter into time-contracts with savers. Savers loan money to the bank for a specified—shorter or longer—period of time in exchange for the banks’ contractual obligation of future repayment plus some additional interest return. From the point of view of savers, they exchange present money for a promise of future money: the interest return constituting their reward for performing the function of waiting. Having thus acquired temporary ownership of savings from savers, the bank then reloans the same money to investors (including itself) in exchange for the latters’ obligation of future repayment and interest. The interest differential—the difference between the interest paid to savers and that charged to borrowers—represents the price for intermediating between savers and investors and constitutes the loan bank’s income. As for deposit banking and deposit fees, under competitive conditions the costs of intermediation also tend to be minimum costs, and the profits from loan banking likewise tend to be the same as those that can be earned elsewhere.

Neither deposit banking nor loan banking as characterized here involve an increase in the money supply or a unilateral income or wealth redistribution. For every newly issued deposit note an equivalent amount of money is taken out of circulation (only the form of money changes, not its quantity), and in the course of loan banking the same sum of money simply changes hands repeatedly. All exchanges—between depositors and depositing institution as well as between savers, the intermediating bank and investors—are mutually advantageous.

In contrast, fractional reserve banking involves a deliberate confusion between the deposit and the loan function. It implies an increase in the money supply, and it leads to a unilateral income redistribution in the bank’s favor as well as to economic inefficiencies in the form of boom-bust business cycles.

The confusion of both banking functions comes to light in the fact that under fractional reserve banking, either depositors are being paid interest (rather than having to pay a fee), and/or savers are granted the right of instant withdrawal (rather than having to wait with their request for redemption until a specified future date). Technically, the possibility of a bank’s engaging in such practices arises out of the fact that the holders of demand deposits (claims to money redeemable on demand, instantly, at par) typically do *not* exercise their right simultaneously, such that all of them approach the bank with the request for redemption at the same time. Accordingly, a deposit bank will typically hold an amount of reserves (of money proper) in excess of actual daily withdrawals. It becomes thus feasible for the bank to loan these “excess” reserves to borrowers, thus earning the bank an interest return (which the bank then may partially pass on to its depositors in the form of interest paying deposit accounts).

Proponents of fractional reserve banking usually claim that this practice of holding less than 100 percent reserves represents merely an innocuous money “economizing”, and they are fond of pointing out that not only the bank, but depositors (receiving interest) and savers (receiving instant withdrawal rights) profit from the practice as well. In fact, fractional reserve banking suffers from two interrelated fatal flaws and is anything but innocuous and all-around beneficial. First off, it should be noted that anything less than 100 percent reserve deposit banking involves what one might call a legal impossibility, for in employing its excess reserves for the granting of credit, the bank actually transfers temporary ownership of them to some borrower, while the depositors, entitled as they are to instant redemption, retain their ownership over the same funds. However, it is impossible that for some time depositor *and* borrower are entitled to exclusive control over the same resources. Two individuals *cannot be* the exclusive owner of one and the same thing at the same time. Accordingly any bank pretending otherwise—in assuming demand liabilities in excess of actual reserves—must be considered as acting fraudulently. Its contractual obligations *cannot be* fulfilled. From the outset, the bank must be regarded as inherently bankrupt—as revealed by the fact that it could not, contrary to its own presumption, withstand a possible bank run.

Second, in lending its excess reserves to borrowers, the bank increases the money supply, regardless whether the borrowers receive these reserves in the form of money proper or in that of demand deposits (checking accounts). If the loan takes the form of genuine money, then the amount of money proper in circulation is increased without withdrawing an equivalent amount of money substitutes from circulation; and if it takes the form of a checking account, then the amount of money substitutes is increased without taking a corresponding amount of genuine money out of circulation. In either case, there will be more money in existence now than before, leading to a reduction in the purchasing power of money (inflation) and, in its course, to a systematic redistribution of real income in favor of the bank and its borrower clients and at the expense of the nonbank public and all other bank clients. The bank receives additional interest income while it makes no additional contribution whatsoever to the real wealth of the nonbank public (as would be the case if the interest return were the result of reduced bank spending, i.e., savings); and the borrowers acquire real, nonmonetary assets with their funds, thereby reducing the real wealth of the rest of the public by the same amount.

Moreover, insofar as the bank does not simply spend the excess reserves on its own consumption but instead loans them out against interest charges, invariably a business cycle is set in motion.[^21] The quantity of credit offered is larger than before. As a consequence, the price of credit—the interest charged for loans—will fall below what it otherwise would have been. At a lower price, more credit is taken. Since money cannot breed more money, in order to be able to earn an interest return and a pure profit on top of it, the borrowers will have to convert their borrowed funds into investments. That is, they will have to purchase or rent factors of production—land, labor, and possibly capital goods (produced factors of production)—capable of producing a future output of goods whose value (price) exceeds that of the input. Accordingly with an expanded volume of credit, more presently available resources will be bound up in the production of *future* goods (instead of being used for present consumption) than otherwise would have been; and in order to complete all investment projects now under way, more time will be needed than that required to complete only those that would have been begun without the credit expansion. All the future goods which would have been created without the expansion plus those that are newly added on account of the credit expansion must be produced.

However, in distinct contrast to the situation in which the interest rate falls due to a fall in the rate of time preference (the degree to which present goods are preferred over future goods), and hence where the public has in fact saved more so as to make a larger fund of present goods available to investors in exchange for their promise of a return of future goods, no such change in time preference and savings has taken place in the case under consideration. The public has *not* saved more, and accordingly, the additional amount of credit granted by the bank does not represent *commodity credit* (credit covered by nonmoney goods which the public has abstained from consuming), but it is *fiduciary* or *circulation credit* (credit that has been literally created out of thin air—without any corresponding sacrifice, in the form of nonconsumed nonmoney goods, on the part of the creditor).[^22] Had the additional credit been commodity credit, an expanded volume of investment activities would have been warranted. There would have been a sufficiently large supply of present goods that could be devoted to the production of future goods such that all—the old as well as the newly begun—investment projects could be successfully completed and a higher level of future consumption attained. If the credit expansion is due to the granting of circulation credit, however, the ensuing volume of investment must actually prove overambitious. Misled by a lower interest rate, investors act *as if* savings had increased. They withdraw more of the presently available resources for investment projects, to be converted into future capital goods, than is warranted in light of actual savings. Consequently, capital goods prices will increase initially relative to consumer goods prices, but once the public’s underlying time preference rate begins to reassert itself, a systematic shortage of consumer goods will arise. Accordingly, the interest rate will adjust upward, and it is now consumer goods prices which rise relative to capital goods prices, requiring the liquidation of part of the investment as unsustainable malinvestment. The earlier boom will turn bust, reducing the future standard of living below the level that otherwise could have been reached.

Among recent proponents of fractional reserve banking the cases of Lawrence White and George Selgin[^23] deserve a few critical comments, if for no other reason than that both are critics of Friedmanite monetarism who hark back, instead, to the tradition of Austrian and in particular Misesian monetary theory.[^24] Their monetary ideal is a universal commodity money such as an international gold standard and, based on this, a system of competitive banking which, they claim, would—and should be permitted to do so for reasons of economic efficiency as well as justice—engage in fractional reserve banking and the granting of fiduciary credit.

As to the question of justice, White and Selgin offer but one argument destined to show the allegedly nonfraudulent character of fractional reserves: that outlawing such a practice would involve a violation of the principle of freedom of contract by preventing “banks and their customers from making whatever sorts of contractual arrangements are mutually agreeable”.[^25] Yet this is surely a silly argument. First off, as a matter of historical fact fractional reserve banks never informed their depositors that some or all of their deposits would actually be loaned out and hence could not possibly be ready for redemption at any time. (Even if the bank were to pay interest on deposit accounts, and hence it *should* have been clear that the bank *must* loan out deposits, this does not imply that any of the depositors actually understand this fact. Indeed, it is safe to say that few if any do, even among those who are not economic illiterates.) Nor did fractional reserve banks inform their borrowers that some or all of the credit granted to them had been created out of thin air and was subject to being recalled at any time. How, then, can their practice be called anything but fraud and embezzlement!

Second, and more decisive, to believe that fractional reserve banking should be regarded as falling under and protected by the principle of freedom of contract involves a complete misunderstanding of the very meaning of this principle. Freedom of contract does not imply that *every* mutually advantageous contract should be permitted. Clearly, if A and B contractually agree to rob C, this would not be in accordance with the principle. Freedom of contract means instead that A and B should be allowed to make any contract whatsoever *regarding their own properties*, yet fractional reserve banking involves the making of contracts regarding the property of third parties. Whenever the bank loans its “excess” reserves to a borrower, such a bilateral contract affects the property of third parties in a threefold way. First, by thereby increasing the money supply, the purchasing power of all other money owners is reduced; second, all depositors are harmed because the likelihood of their successfully recovering their own possessions is lowered; and third, all other borrowers—borrowers of commodity credit—are harmed because the injection of fiduciary credit impairs the safety of the entire credit structure and increases the risk of a business failure for every investor of commodity credit.

In order to overcome these objections to the claim that fractional reserve banking accords with the principle of freedom of contract, White and Selgin then, as their last line of defense, withdraw to the position that banks may attach an “option clause” to their notes, informing depositors that the bank may at any time suspend or defer redemption, and letting borrowers know that their loans may be instantly recalled.[^26] While such a practice would indeed dispose of the charge of fraud, it is subject to another fundamental criticism, for such notes would no longer be *money* but a peculiar form of *lottery tickets*.[^27] It is the function of money to serve as the most easily resalable and most widely acceptable good, so as to prepare its owner for instant purchases of directly or indirectly serviceable consumer or producer goods at not yet known future dates; hence, whatever may serve as money so as to be instantly resalable at any future point in time, it must be something that bestows an *absolute* and *unconditional* property right on its owner. In sharp contrast, the owner of a note to which an option clause is attached does *not* possess an unconditional property title. Rather, similar to the holder of a “fractional reserve parking ticket” (where more tickets are sold than there are parking places on hand, and lots are allocated according to a “first-come-firstserved” rule), he is merely entitled to participate in the drawing of certain prizes, consisting of ownership or time-rental services to specified goods according to specified rules. But as drawing rights—and not unconditional ownership titles—they only possess *temporally conditional* value until the time of the drawing, and they become worthless as soon as the prizes have been allocated to the ticket holders; thus, they would be uniquely *un*suited to serve as a medium of exchange.

As em concern de second issue: say fractiotional reserve banking dey economically good, em dey important to show say White, although em dey undoubtedly familiar wit de Austrian-Misesian claim say *any* injection of fiduciary credit go result for boom-bust cycle, no wia dem mention de proble wey concern business cycles. Only Selgin address de problem. For em attempt to show say fractional reserve banking no dey cause business cycles, infact, Selgin con fall headlong for de fundamental Keynesian error to dey confuse de demand for money (fit get from de use of money) and savings (fit cause by time choice).[^28]

According to Selgin, “to hold money inside money na to engage for free saving”; and normally “increase for demand for money fit cause increase for bank loans and investment” becos

> [a]nytime bank wan expand em liabilities for de process to dey make new loan and investment, na de holder of de liability wey be de ultimate lender for credit, and wetin dem dey lend na de main resource dem fit get if, instead dem hold money, dem go spend am.[^29]

Base on dis view of holding money say em be saving and de increase for de demand for money like say na de same tin wit increase for saving, den, Selgin con go yab Mises claim say *any* issuance of fiduciary media, to dey low em interest rate below em “natural” level, go cause business cycle dey “confused.” No bad result dey come from to dey issue fiduciary media take react to big demand for balance wey dey inside money.”[^30]

Yet de confusion all na Selgin own. First say, na lie to say to dey hold money (say you no dey spend am), dey equal to dey save am. Person fit still talk say- dis one still dey wrong- say person nor dey spend money em dey equal to say de person nor dey save. De demand for money na de mind nor dey to dey buy or rent nonmoney goods, and dis one join consumer goods (present goods) *and capital goods (future goods). Nor dey spend money na to dey buy *nor be* even consumer goods *nor* be investment goods. Against Selgin talk, den de matter dey like dis: People fit put dia money monetary assets for one of de three ways. Dem fit spend am for consumer goods; dem fit spend am for investment; or dem fit keep am for de form of cash. Anoda alternative nor dey again. Wey be say person must always dey make decision as em concern three margin at once, everytime de result dey determined by two separate praxeologically unrelated factors. De consumption/investment level (de decision of how much of person spend em money for consumption and investment) dey determined by em time predference (de extend wey em like present consumption pass future consumption). For de other hand, de source of em demand for money na de use attach to de money (de personal satisfaction em get from de money to allow am sahrperly buy tins directly abi indirectly serviceable consumer or producer goods for one kind time for future).

Normally, if de demand for money increase wen dem give de social stock of money, dem fit only satisfy dis additional demand if dem dey bid down de price of nonmoney goods. De purchasing power of money go increase, de *real* value of personal cash balance go increase, and na for bigger purchasing power per unit of money, de demand and supply for money go con balance. De relative price of money versus nonmoney go don change. But unless say time choice dem assume am say em don change at de same time, *real* consumption and *real* investment go remain de same as em dey before: de additional money demand dey satisfied by to dey reduce nominal consumption *and* investment spending as em dey in line wit de same, former consumption/investment proportion, go dey drag de price of both consumer and producer goods go down and em go leave real consumption and investment for dia normal old level. If dem assume time choice to dey change de same time wit de way demand dey increase for money, even self, den everything dey possible. Infact, if dem reduce spending normally for investment goods, increase for money go even go hand in hand wit de increase for de rate of interest and go reduce saving and investment. Howeva, dis, or de equal possible opposite result, nor go be becos of de change for demand for money but na mainly for change (rise or em fall) for de time choice schedule. For any case, if dem allow de banking system make em follow Selgin advice and make em join de increase for demand for money by to dey give fiduciary credit, de social rate for time choice dem go forge am, too much investment go happen, and boom-bust cycle go con dey, go con make de practice of fractional reserve banking dey fraudulent *and like say* economically nor good.

White and Selgin proposal for commodity money base system of competitive fractional reserve banking- of small paper money- nor jux be (even self de term “free banking” nor dey appropriate), nor be say em dey provide economic stability. Em no be any fundamental improvement if you compare am to monetarist reality of monopolistically issue pure paper money.infact, for one side Friedman pure paper money proposal contain many real and correct analysis pass White and Selgin becos say Friedman recognize “wetin dem dey call ‘de inside wahala’ of fractional reserve banking,” and em undastand say dis ‘inside wahala’ of fractional reserve banking go soon or later collapse for “liquidity crisis” and fit lead to em favor regime- government dey provide paper money-anyhow.[^31]

Only for system of world commodity money (gold), competitive banks, *and* 100-percent-reserve deposit banking join strict functional separation of loan and deposit banking still join normal monetary system wey fit assure economic good and show better answer to de main currency wahala.
