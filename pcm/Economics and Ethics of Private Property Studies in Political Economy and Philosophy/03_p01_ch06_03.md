### From Deposit and Loan Banking to Fractional Reserve Banking: The Devolution of Credit

Banks perform two strictly separate tasks, only one of which has been considered so far.[^20] On the one hand, they serve as depositing institutions, offering safekeeping and clearing services. They accept deposits of (commodity) money and issue claims to money (warehouse receipts; money substitutes) to their depositors, redeemable at par and on demand. For every claim to money issued by them they hold an equivalent amount of genuine money on hand, ready for redemption (100 percent reserve banking). No interest is paid on deposits. Rather, depositors pay a fee to the bank for providing safekeeping and clearing services. Under conditions of free competition—free entry into the banking industry—the deposit fee, which constitutes a bank’s revenue and possible source of profit, tends to be a minimum fee; and the profits—or rather, the interest returns—earned in banking tend to be the same as in any other, nonbanking industry.

On the other hand, originally entirely separate institutionally from deposit institutions, banks also serve as intermediaries between savers and investors—as loan banks. In this function they first offer and enter into time-contracts with savers. Savers loan money to the bank for a specified—shorter or longer—period of time in exchange for the banks’ contractual obligation of future repayment plus some additional interest return. From the point of view of savers, they exchange present money for a promise of future money: the interest return constituting their reward for performing the function of waiting. Having thus acquired temporary ownership of savings from savers, the bank then reloans the same money to investors (including itself) in exchange for the latters’ obligation of future repayment and interest. The interest differential—the difference between the interest paid to savers and that charged to borrowers—represents the price for intermediating between savers and investors and constitutes the loan bank’s income. As for deposit banking and deposit fees, under competitive conditions the costs of intermediation also tend to be minimum costs, and the profits from loan banking likewise tend to be the same as those that can be earned elsewhere.

Neither deposit banking nor loan banking as characterized here involve an increase in the money supply or a unilateral income or wealth redistribution. For every newly issued deposit note an equivalent amount of money is taken out of circulation (only the form of money changes, not its quantity), and in the course of loan banking the same sum of money simply changes hands repeatedly. All exchanges—between depositors and depositing institution as well as between savers, the intermediating bank and investors—are mutually advantageous.

In contrast, fractional reserve banking involves a deliberate confusion between the deposit and the loan function. It implies an increase in the money supply, and it leads to a unilateral income redistribution in the bank’s favor as well as to economic inefficiencies in the form of boom-bust business cycles.

The confusion of both banking functions comes to light in the fact that under fractional reserve banking, either depositors are being paid interest (rather than having to pay a fee), and/or savers are granted the right of instant withdrawal (rather than having to wait with their request for redemption until a specified future date). Technically, the possibility of a bank’s engaging in such practices arises out of the fact that the holders of demand deposits (claims to money redeemable on demand, instantly, at par) typically do *not* exercise their right simultaneously, such that all of them approach the bank with the request for redemption at the same time. Accordingly, a deposit bank will typically hold an amount of reserves (of money proper) in excess of actual daily withdrawals. It becomes thus feasible for the bank to loan these “excess” reserves to borrowers, thus earning the bank an interest return (which the bank then may partially pass on to its depositors in the form of interest paying deposit accounts).

Proponents of fractional reserve banking usually claim that this practice of holding less than 100 percent reserves represents merely an innocuous money “economizing”, and they are fond of pointing out that not only the bank, but depositors (receiving interest) and savers (receiving instant withdrawal rights) profit from the practice as well. In fact, fractional reserve banking suffers from two interrelated fatal flaws and is anything but innocuous and all-around beneficial. First off, it should be noted that anything less than 100 percent reserve deposit banking involves what one might call a legal impossibility, for in employing its excess reserves for the granting of credit, the bank actually transfers temporary ownership of them to some borrower, while the depositors, entitled as they are to instant redemption, retain their ownership over the same funds. However, it is impossible that for some time depositor *and* borrower are entitled to exclusive control over the same resources. Two individuals *cannot be* the exclusive owner of one and the same thing at the same time. Accordingly any bank pretending otherwise—in assuming demand liabilities in excess of actual reserves—must be considered as acting fraudulently. Its contractual obligations *cannot be* fulfilled. From the outset, the bank must be regarded as inherently bankrupt—as revealed by the fact that it could not, contrary to its own presumption, withstand a possible bank run.

Second, in lending its excess reserves to borrowers, the bank increases the money supply, regardless whether the borrowers receive these reserves in the form of money proper or in that of demand deposits (checking accounts). If the loan takes the form of genuine money, then the amount of money proper in circulation is increased without withdrawing an equivalent amount of money substitutes from circulation; and if it takes the form of a checking account, then the amount of money substitutes is increased without taking a corresponding amount of genuine money out of circulation. In either case, there will be more money in existence now than before, leading to a reduction in the purchasing power of money (inflation) and, in its course, to a systematic redistribution of real income in favor of the bank and its borrower clients and at the expense of the nonbank public and all other bank clients. The bank receives additional interest income while it makes no additional contribution whatsoever to the real wealth of the nonbank public (as would be the case if the interest return were the result of reduced bank spending, i.e., savings); and the borrowers acquire real, nonmonetary assets with their funds, thereby reducing the real wealth of the rest of the public by the same amount.

Moreova, as far as say bank no dey simply spend de excess reserve on wetin em dey chop but dey loan dem out opposite to interest charge, everytime dem put business cycle for motion.[^21] De size of credit dem give big pass de one before. As result, de price of credit- de interest dem charge for loans- go fall pass wetin em suppose even be. For price wey low, dem dey collect more credit. Since money nor fit bring more money, make dem take dey earn interest back and legit profit on top of am, de persin wey borrow go need convert de money em borrow take invest. Na to say, dem go need buy or rent tins of production- land, workers, and self capital goods (wey be factors of production em bring)- wey fit produce future result of goods wey em value (price) pass de one wey dem input. Normally, wit increase for volume of de credit, dem go bound de resource wey dey now take produce *future* goods (instead of to dey use de consumption for now) dan em for be; so em for complete all de investtement projects now wey dey, em for need time pass wetin em require to complete only dos ones wey for don start witout say dem increase de credit. All de future goods wey dem for create witout dia expansion take add dos one wey dem add new base on de credit expansion dem must provide am.

Infact, for separate opposite to de matter wey de interest rate fall becos of de fall for choice for time (de extend wey dem like today goods pass future own), and den wen de public don save many make dem for make big fund of goods now dey available to people wey invest take exchange for de ones dem go get back for future, nor get any change for time like and to dey save don happen for de matter we dey consida. De public dem *nor* save more, and normally, de amount of credit dem add wey de bank allow nor dey represent *commodity credit* (de credit wey dey covered by nonmoney goods wey de people don comot dia hand to dey consume), but na *trustee* or *credit wey circulate* (credit wey jux come out from wia dem no know- witout say dem work for am, wey be like dem no chop nonmoney goods, for de part of de creditor).[^22] To say de credit dem add be commodity credit, de need to increase de size of de investment activities for dey dia. Em for dey enough big supply for goods wey dey now wey dem go put take produce future goods wey be say- de old one like de new one go start- investment project wey dem fit jejely complete and future eating for dey guaranteed. If de way de credit dey big na becos of to dey grant circulation credit, even self, de ensuing size of de investement go really show extra ambition. Misled am wit small interest rate, dos wey invest dey do *like say* savings don high. Dem witdraw many of de present resource wey dey for dia investment project, to take convert am for future to capital goods, dan say dem give am for actual savings. Even like dat, capital goods dia price go increase first compare to consumer goods dia price, but once say de public mind for time preference begin to dey show em self, one kind pattern of shortage for consumer goods go happen. Normally, de interest rate go jux go up, and na consumer dia goods price go con increase compare to de capital goods dia price, em go require say dem liquidate part of de investment like unsustainable malinvestment. De early boom go turn bust, em go con reduce de future standard of living pass de de level wey em for no reach.

Among current people wey dey support fractional reserve banking de case of Lawrence White and George Selgin[^23] derserve some kind yabbing, if no be for any reason dan say de two of dem dey yab Friedmanite monetarism who hear back, instead, for de tradition of Austrian and for particular Misesian monetary theory.[^24] Dia monetary standard na world commodity money like international gold standard and, base on dis, system of competitive banking wey, dem claim, go- and suppose permit to do am for wetin concern economic good and justice- put hand for fractional reserve banking and to dey give fudiciary credit.

As em concern justice matter, White and Selgin jux put one argument wey show de allegedly nonfraudulent character of fractional reserves: to comot dat kind practice go follow breach de principle wey concern freedom of contract to stop “bank and dia customer to dey make any kind contract arrangement wey dem two gree.”[^25] even self dis one nay eye argument. First, say as em concern history fractional reserve bank neva tell dos wey dey deposit say some or all of dia deposit go dey loaned out and em no fit ready to collect for any time. (Even say de bank dem pay interest for deposit account, and den em *suppose* dey clear say de bank *go* loan out deposits, dis one no show say anybody wey dey deposit undastand de fact. Infact, em dey safe to talk if few or any at all, even people wey no sabi economics.) Fractional reserve banks nor even tell people wey dey borrow say all de credits dem dey give na from thin air and dem fit recall am at any time. How, de, dem fit call wetin dem dey do fraud and embezzlement!

Second, and more direct, to dey believe say fractitional reserve banking dem go see am to dey fall under and get protection from principle of freedom of contract show total misundastanding of de main meaning of de principle. Freedom of contract no show say *all* common legit contract dem suppose allow am. Normally, if A and B join agree make dem rob C, dis one no jux follow de principle. Freedom of contract mean say instead make dem let A and B do any contract *wey concern dia own property*, yet fractional reserve banking na to dey don contract wey concer property of third parties. Anytime bank loan em “excess” reserve to who dey borrow, dat kind bilateral contract dey affect de property of third parties for three way. First, na by to dey increase de money supply, de level people wey get money dey buy go con reduce; second na say, people wey dey deposit dey hear word because de means make dem for take get dia belongings back go dey low; de third be say, people wey dey borrow- wey dey borrow commodity credit- em go affect dem becos dem put fiduciary credit em dey affect de safety of de whole credit pattern and dey increase de risk of say de business go fail for people wey dey invest for commodity credit.

In order say dem overcome dis disagreement to de claim say fractiotional reserve banking dey in line wit de principle wey concern freedom of contract, White and Selgin den, as dia last line to defense, witdraw wetin dem yarn before say banks go put “option clause” to dia notes, dey con tell people wey dey deposit say bank fit from anytime stop dia claim, dem still let people wey dey borrow know say dem fit pay dia loan back sharperly.[^26] Wey be say dis kind tin go stop matter like fraud, em con still get wetin dem go take yab am, dat kind note no go con be *money* but con be one kind *lottery tickets*.[^27] Na de function of money to dey be wetin dem fit sell again and most common goods dem dey accept, make em take prepare de owner to sharperly buy direct or indirect important consumer or producer goods for later later for future, em go be sometin wey show *absolute* and *unconditional* property right on em owner. Against dis tin, de person wey get de note wey dem for put de option clause *nor* get unconditional property title. Rada, resemble  person wey hold “fractional reserve parking ticket” (wia dem dey sell many ticket pass wia dem dey park, and dem dey do am base on “first-come_firstserved” rule), em dey entitled to participate to dey collect some prize, wey include ownership or time-rental services to some kind goods base on some kind rules. But na drawing right- nor be unconditional ownership titles- dem only get *short time condition* value until em reach time for de draw, and dem no go get value again as sharp as dem give de prize to dem wey hold tickets; den, dem go dey one kind *un*suited to use am take dey exchange.

As regards the second contention: that fractional reserve banking is economically efficient, it is noteworthy to point out that White, although he is undoubtedly familiar with the Austrian-Misesian claim that *any* injection of fiduciary credit must result in a boom-bust cycle, nowhere even mentions the problem of business cycles. Only Selgin addresses the problem. In his attempt to show that fractional reserve banking does not cause business cycles, however, Selgin then falls headlong into the fundamental Keynesian error of confusing the demand for money (determined by the utility of money) and savings (determined by time preference).[^28]

According to Selgin, “to hold inside money is to engage in voluntary saving”; and accordingly “an increase in the demand for money warrants an increase in bank loans and investments” because

> [w]henever a bank expands its liabilities in the process of making new loans and investments, it is the holders of the liabilities who are the ultimate lenders of credit, and what they lend are the real resources they could acquire if, instead of holding money, they spent it.[^29]

Based on this view of the holding of money as representing saving and an increased demand for money as being the same thing as increased saving, then, Selgin goes on to criticize Mises’s claim that *any* issuance of fiduciary media, in lowering the interest rate below its “natural” level, must cause a business cycle as “confused”. “No ill consequences result from the issue of fiduciary media in response to a greater demand for balances of inside money”.[^30]

Yet the confusion is all Selgin’s. First off, it is false to say that the holding of money (the act of not spending it), is equivalent to saving. One might as well say—and this would be equally wrong—that the not-spending of money is equivalent to *not* saving. In fact, saving is not-consuming, and the demand for money has nothing to do with saving or not-saving. The demand for money is the unwillingness to buy or rent nonmoney goods, and these include consumer goods (present goods) *and* capital goods (future goods). Not-spending money is to purchase, *neither* consumer goods *nor* investment goods. Contrary to Selgin, then, matters are as follows: Individuals may employ their monetary assets in one of three ways. They can spend them on consumer goods; they can spend them on investment; or they can keep them in the form of cash. There are no other alternatives. While a person must at all times make decisions regarding three margins at once, invariably the outcome is determined by two distinct and praxeologically unrelated factors. The consumption/investment proportion (the decision of how much of one’s money to spend on consumption and how much on investment) is determined by a person’s time preference (the degree to which he prefers present consumption over future consumption). On the other hand, the source of his demand for cash is the utility attached to money (the personal satisfaction derived from money in allowing him immediate purchases of directly or indirectly serviceable consumer or producer goods at uncertain future dates).

Accordingly, if the demand for money increases while the social stock of money is given, this additional demand can only be satisfied by bidding down the money prices of nonmoney goods. The purchasing power of money will increase, the *real* value of individual cash balances will be raised, and at a higher purchasing power per unit money, the demand for and the supply of money will once again be equilibrated. The relative price of money versus nonmoney will have changed. But unless time preference is assumed to have changed at the same time, *real* consumption and *real* investment will remain the same as before: the additional money demand is satisfied by reducing nominal consumption *and* investment spending in accordance with the same pre-existing consumption/investment proportion, driving the money prices of both consumer as well as producer goods down and leaving real consumption and investment at precisely their old levels. If time preference is assumed to change concomitantly with an increased demand for money, however, then everything is possible. Indeed, if spending were reduced exclusively on investment goods, an increased demand for money could even go hand in hand with an increase in the rate of interest and reduced saving and investment. However, this, or the equally possible opposite outcome, would not be due to a change in the demand for money but exclusively to a change (a rise, or a fall) in the time preference schedule. In any case, if the banking system were to follow Selgin’s advice and accommodate an increased demand for cash by issuing fiduciary credit, the social rate of time preference would be falsified, excessive investment would result, and a boom-bust cycle would be set in motion, rendering the practice of fractional reserve banking fraudulent *as well as* economically inefficient.

White’s and Selgin’s proposal of a commodity money based system of competitive fractional reserve banking—of partial fiat money—is neither just (and hence the term “free banking” is inappropriate), nor does it produce economic stability. It is no fundamental improvement as compared to the monetarist reality of monopolistically issued pure fiat currencies. Indeed, in one respect Friedman’s pure fiat money proposal contains a more realistic and correct analysis than White’s and Selgin’s because Friedman recognizes “what used to be called ‘the inherent instability’ of fractional reserve banking”, and he understands that this inherent instability of competitive fractional reserve banking will sooner or later collapse in a “liquidity crisis” and then lead to his favored regime—a governmentally provided pure fiat currency—anyway.[^31]

Only a system of universal commodity money (gold), competitive banks, *and* 100-percent-reserve deposit banking with a strict functional separation of loan and deposit banking constitutes a just monetary system that can assure economic stability and present a genuine answer to the current monetarist fiasco.
